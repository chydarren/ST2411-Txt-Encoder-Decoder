# Txt Encoder and Decoder

## Introduction

This ia a C program to encode or decode a text file based on an obfuscation scheme. 

For encoding, the program reads in the content of a text file and first converts each character of the text file into the corresponding 
2-digit hexadecimal string. E.g. an 'A' will be converted to '41'.  The program will then swap the 2 digits of the (in order to hide the 
real value). Ie.  An 'A' will be encoded to '14'.

For decoding, the program will just reverse the encoding scheme and convert a sequence of encoded string into the original text.
